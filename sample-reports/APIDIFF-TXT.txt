API Comparison Results


Delivered by Open API Diff tooling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The report layout uses three sections: short, elaborate and compliance
The reports shows the added endpoints, the removed and the changed endpoints on a short form.
The changed endpoints are succeeding that presented in a more elaborate form
The syntax used is:
  +  means added.
  -  means removed.
  @  means altered.
  !  means (in Existing API).
  >  means (in the New API).
 (C) means (Compliance).

The APIs compared are:
 - ! ./sample-api/elaborate_example_v1.json
 - > ./sample-api/elaborate_example_v3f.json


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added Endpoints
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + /accounts/{regNo}-{accountNo}/cards
   obtain cards associated with a given account
 + /virtual-accounts/{regNo}-{accountNo}
   gets the information from a single virtual account
 + /virtual-accounts/{regNo}-{accountNo}
   Create new or update existing virtual account
 + /virtual-accounts
   lists virtual accounts
